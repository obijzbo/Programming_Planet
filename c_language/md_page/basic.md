#  C Has Become very popular for various reasons

1.One of the early programming languages
2.Still, the best programming language to learn quickly.
3.C language is reliable, simple, and easy to use.
4.C language is a structured language.
5.Modern programming concepts are based on C.
6.It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
7.Universities preferred to add C programming in their courseware


# Features of C Programming language

1.C is a robust language with a rich set of built-in functions and operators
2.Programs written in C are efficient and fast
3.C is highly portable; programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification
4.C is a collection of C library functions; we can also create our function and add it to the C library.
5.C is easily extensible.


# Advantage of C

1.C is the building block for many other programming languages
2.Programs written in C are highly portable
3.Several standard functions are there (like in-built) that can be used to develop programs
4.C programs are collections of C library functions, and it's also easy to add functions to the C library
5.The modular structure makes code debugging, maintenance, and testing easier


# Disadvantage of C

1.C does not provide Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
2.There are no concepts of Namespace in C.
3.C does not provide binding or wrapping up of data in a single unit
4.C does not provide Constructor and Destructor.


# C Language Fundamental

### C Support Six Types of Tokens:
1.**Identifiers**
2.**Keywords**
3.**Constants**
4.**string**
5.**operators**
6.**Special symbol**


## Identifiers
```
int amount;
double number;

```
In the above example **amount** and **number** are **Identifiers**.

## Rules for Naming Identifiers
1.An identifier can only have alphanumeric characters (a-z , A-Z , 0-9) (i.e. letters & digits) and underscore( _ ) symbol
2.Identifier names must be unique
3.The first character must be an alphabet or underscore
4.You cannot use a keyword as identifiers
5.Only the first thirty-one (31) characters are significant.
6.It must not contain white spaces
7.Identifiers are case-sensitive.

## Keywords

The C Keywords must be in your information because you can not use them as a variable name.

You can't use a keyword as an identifier in your C programs, its reserved words in C library and used to perform an internal operation. The meaning and working of these keywords are already known to the compiler

### C Keywords List

|auto   |double   | int       | struct   |
|-------|:-------:|:---------:|---------:|
|break  |else     | long      | switch   |
|case   |enum     | register  | typedef  |
|char   |extern   | return    | union    |
|const  |float    | shrot     | unsigned |
|for    |continue | signed    | void     |
|do     |goto     | sizeof    | volatile |
|if     |default  | static    | while    |


## Constants

Constants are like a variable, except that their value never changes during execution once defined.

C Constants is the most fundamental and essential part of the C programming language. Constants in C are the fixed values that are used in a program, and its value remains the same during the entire execution of the program

## operators

C operators are symbols that are used to perform mathematical or logical manipulations. The C programming language is rich with built-in operators. Operators take part in a program for manipulating data and variables and form a part of the mathematical or logical expressions.

### Types of Operator in C
1. Arithmetic operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical operator
4. Assignment operators
5. Increment & Decrement Operators
6. Conditional operators
7. Bitwise operators
8. Special Operators

|  *       | Multiplication|
|  /       | Division      |
|  %       | Modulus       |


### Increment & Decrement Operators

| Operotor | Description |
| ++       | Increment   |
| --       | Decrement   |


### Relational Operators

| Operator  | Description      |
| ==        | Is equal to      |
| !=        | is not equal to  |

| <=        | less or equal    |


### Logical Operator

1. **&&** ( and operator)
2. **||** (or operator)
3. **!**(not operator)

3. * (pointer to a variable)



## C Data Types

A data-type in C programming is a set of values and is determined to act on those values. C provides various types of data-types which allow the programmer to select the appropriate type for the variable to set its value.

The data-type in a programming language is the collection of data with values having fixed meaning as well as characteristics. Some of them are an integer, floating point, character, etc. Usually, programming languages specify the range values for given data-type.

## ANSI C provides 3 types of datatypes:

1. Primary(Built-in)Data Types:
